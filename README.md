## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Matillion Data Productivity Cloud** pipelines designed for learning and practicing modern data engineering patterns. The project demonstrates various ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflows using Matillion's orchestration and transformation capabilities with Snowflake as the target data warehouse.

## 🚀 Key Learning Areas

### 1. **API Integration & JSON Processing**
- **Pipeline**: `APLIntegration/trns_api_json_flattend.tran.yaml`
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - JSON data flattening using `flatten-variant` components
  - Nested data extraction from complex JSON structures
  - Handling both IPv4 and IPv6 prefix data
  - Column mapping and data type transformations

### 2. **Orchestration Patterns**
- **Pipelines**: Multiple orchestration workflows in `/Orchestration/`
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Iterator patterns for processing multiple datasets
  - S3 to Snowflake data loading workflows
  - Conditional logic and workflow control
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 3. **File Processing Workflows**
- **Pipeline**: `workflows/s3-csv-file-processor.orch.yaml`
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - CSV file ingestion from S3
  - Schema detection and validation
  - Incremental data loading patterns

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Matillion Data Productivity Cloud**: Primary ELT platform
- **Snowflake**: Cloud data warehouse
- **Amazon S3**: Data lake storage
- **JSON/CSV**: Data formats processed
- **YAML**: Pipeline configuration language (DPL)

## 📋 Prerequisites

To work with these pipelines, you need:

1. **Matillion Data Productivity Cloud** account
2. **Snowflake** warehouse access
3. **AWS S3** bucket (for file-based workflows)
4. Basic understanding of ELT concepts

## 🎯 How to Use This Project

### Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Import the pipeline files into your Matillion environment
3. Configure your Snowflake and S3 connections
4. Update database/schema references as needed

### Running the Pipelines

#### API JSON Flattening Workflow
```bash
# 1. Ensure you have source data in the 'ip_range' table
# 2. Run the transformation pipeline:
APLIntegration/trns_api_json_flattend.tran.yaml
```

#### S3 to Snowflake Orchestration
```bash
# 1. Configure your S3 bucket connections
# 2. Run the orchestration pipeline:
Orchestration/orc_s3_to_snowflake.orch.yaml
```

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

After working through these pipelines, you will understand:

- ✅ How to design modular, reusable data pipelines
- ✅ JSON data flattening and transformation techniques
- ✅ Orchestration patterns for complex workflows
- ✅ Iterator patterns for processing multiple data sources
- ✅ Error handling and data validation strategies
- ✅ Best practices for Snowflake data loading
- ✅ Integration patterns with cloud storage services

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Database Connection
- **Warehouse**: `COMPUTE_WH`
- **Database**: `MATILLION`
- **Schema**: `STAGE`

### Environment Variables
Most pipelines use `[Environment Default]` for database connections. Update these as needed for your environment.

## 🤝 Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Modular Design**: Separate orchestration and transformation concerns
2. **Clear Naming**: Descriptive pipeline and component names
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling patterns
4. **Documentation**: Well-documented pipeline configurations
5. **Reusability**: Template-based approach for common patterns

## 📈 Advanced Features

- **Variant Data Handling**: Advanced JSON/semi-structured data processing
- **Nested Data Extraction**: Complex data structure flattening
- **Iterator Patterns**: Dynamic data processing workflows
- **Conditional Logic**: Smart workflow routing
